# 🤖 CS50AI: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains my personal notes and selected solutions to problem sets from **Harvard University's CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (CS50AI)**.
The course, taught by **Professor Brian Yu** and offered through Harvard and edX, examines the foundational concepts and algorithms that underpin modern artificial intelligence, with a focus on both theoretical principles and practical applications.

Students learn how to design and implement intelligent systems by working with algorithms for search, optimization, machine learning, and more, gaining the skills to apply AI techniques to a variety of real-world problems.

## 📚 About the Course

**CS50AI** is a rigorous and self-paced course that blends **computer science theory**, **mathematical reasoning**, and **hands-on programming in Python**.
It explores the building blocks of AI and machine learning, emphasizing how these methods can be used to solve complex tasks that traditionally require human intelligence.

Throughout the course, students gain an understanding of how machines can:
- Make decisions by **searching through possible outcomes**
- Represent and manipulate **knowledge** to draw logical conclusions
- Handle **uncertainty** in data and events through probability
- Find **optimal solutions** rather than just correct ones
- **Learn from experience** and improve performance over time
- Use **neural networks** to perform high-level tasks in vision, speech, and more
- **Process natural language**, enabling interaction with human text and speech

This course also introduces widely used Python libraries and frameworks for AI and machine learning, providing learners with practical tools to build and experiment with their own intelligent programs.

## 🗂 Topics Covered

The course is organized into lectures, each focusing on a major concept in AI:

0. **[Search](#lecture-0---search)**: Finding a solution to a problem, like a navigator app that finds the best route from your origin to the destination, or like playing a game and figuring out the next move
1. **[Knowledge](#lecture-1---knowledge)**: Representing information and drawing inferences from it
2. **[Uncertainty](#lecture-2---uncertainty)**: Dealing with uncertain events using probability
3. **[Optimization](#lecture-3---optimization)**: Finding not only a correct way to solve a problem, but a better—or the best—way to solve it
4. **[Learning](#lecture-4---learning)**: Improving performance based on access to data and experience. For example, your email is able to distinguish spam from non-spam mail based on past experience
5. **[Neural Networks](#lecture-5---neural-networks)**: A program structure inspired by the human brain that is able to perform tasks effectively
6. **[Language](#lecture-6---language)**: Processing natural language, which is produced and understood by humans
